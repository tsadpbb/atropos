You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.
```

**Reward Function:**
- Score of 1.0 if the model's response correctly follows the instruction, as determined by the specific verifier function associated with the input prompt.
- Score of 0.0 if the response fails the verifier function or has malformed `<think>` tags (must have exactly one opening and one closing tag).

- `pydantic`

**Dataset:**
- Default: `princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_Lite_oracle`

**Input Format (for the model via prompts):**
- `problem_statement`: The issue text.
- `content`: Relevant code segments from one or more files.

**System Prompts:**
1.  **Thinking System Prompt:**
    ```
    You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.
    ```
2.  **Task System Prompt:**
    ```
    A user will ask you to solve a task. You should generate the solution. Your response format must follow the template below:
    ```
    (Followed by instructions on the SEARCH/REPLACE format)

**User Prompt Template:**
```
We are currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here is the issue text:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
{problem_statement}
--- END ISSUE ---
Below are some code segments, each from a relevant file. One or more of these files may contain bugs.
--- BEGIN FILE ---
``` {content} ```
--- END FILE ---
Please first localize the bug based on the issue statement, and then generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
1. The file path
2. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
3. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
4. The dividing line: =======
5. The lines to replace into the source code
6. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
Here is an example:
```python
### mathweb/flask/app.py
import math
from flask import Flask
```
Please note that the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. If you would like to add the line ’ print(x)’, you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code!
Wrap each *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit in a code block as shown in the example above. If you have multiple *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits, use a separate code block for each one.
```

**Reward Function:**
- Primary reward is based on the `SequenceMatcher` ratio between the model's reconstructed generated patch and the oracle patch.
- A score of -1.0 is given initially.
- If the model's response has a `finish_reason` of "length", or if `<think>` tags are present but malformed, the reward remains -1.0 and advantage is set to zero for "length".
- If the SEARCH/REPLACE patch format is correctly parsed from the model's output (after potentially extracting content from `<think> </think>` tags):
    - The `SequenceMatcher.ratio()` between the reconstructed predicted patch and the `oracle_patch_str` is used as the reward.
- Buffers track:
    - `percent_format_correct_buffer`: Percentage of responses with correctly formatted patches.
    - `similarity_score_buffer`: List of similarity scores for correctly formatted patches.
    - `think_tags_present_buffer`: Percentage of responses where `<think>` tags were present.
    - `think_tags_well_formed_buffer`: Percentage of responses where `<think>` tags were present AND well-formed.

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- `eval/avg_similarity_score_correct_patch_format`: Average similarity score for responses that had a correctly formatted patch.
- `eval/patch_format_accuracy`: Proportion of evaluation items where the patch was correctly formatted.
- `eval/pass_at_1`: Proportion of evaluation items where the patch was correct and achieved a similarity score of 1.0.
- `eval/avg_think_tags_present`: Average presence of think tags in evaluation responses.
- `eval/avg_think_tags_well_formed`: Average well-formedness of think tags in evaluation responses.

**Unique Configuration and Features:**
- **Dataset Handling:** Loads training and test data from Hugging Face datasets, specifically tailored for SWE-bench like formats.
- **Patch Parsing:** Implements robust parsing for a specific SEARCH/REPLACE patch format.
- **Thinking Tag Processing:** Extracts content after `<think> </think>` tags for patch generation, and scores based on presence and well-formedness of these tags.
- **Wandb Logging:** Logs detailed training and evaluation metrics, including rollout tables with problem statements, full interaction text, oracle patches, and scores.

## 33. Goofy Math Environment

**Location:** `environments/community/goofy_math/`
**Contributor:** [chinguun101](https://github.com/chinguun101)
**PR:** [#91](https://github.com/NousResearch/atropos/pull/91)

### Core Features
- **Dual Reward System**: Mathematical correctness verification + goofiness scoring
- **RLAIF-Based Judging**: AI feedback system for ranking entertaining vs. standard solutions
- **GSM8K Integration**: Uses standard math dataset with humor enhancement overlay
- **Position Bias Elimination**: Forward/reverse judgment pairs to ensure fair evaluation

### Technical Implementation
- **Environment Name**: `goofy_math`
- **Correctness Verification**: Uses `math_verify` and `latex2sympy2_extended` for objective scoring
- **Goofiness Assessment**: LLM judge evaluates entertainment value of mathematically correct solutions
- **Reward Formula**: `score = correctness_score + (goofiness_bonus * 0.5)`
- **Output Format**: `<think>...</think>` reasoning + `\boxed{answer}` format

### Research Applications
- **Educational AI**: Training math tutors that are both accurate and engaging
- **Personality Injection**: Adding entertainment value while maintaining technical correctness
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Balancing objective accuracy with subjective entertainment
- **Humor in AI**: Systematic approach to training models for appropriate comedic timing

### Setup and Usage
```bash
# Install requirements
pip install -r environments/community/goofy_math/requirements.txt

# Environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"

# Process mode for examples
python environments/community/goofy_math/goofy_math_server.py process \
  --env.data_path_to_save_groups goofy_math_demo.jsonl \
  --env.total_steps 3

# Training mode
python -m atroposlib.cli.dpo \
    --env-module "environments.community.goofy_math.goofy_math_server"
```

### Performance Characteristics
- **Correctness Requirement**: Solutions must pass mathematical verification to receive any reward
- **Goofiness Scoring**: 0-1 range based on humor, sound effects, and creative explanations
- **Reward Distribution**: Base 1.0 for correctness + up to 0.5 bonus for entertainment value
- **Anti-Reward Hacking**: Goofiness only evaluated after correctness verification
- **W&B Integration**: Tracks goofiness histograms, judgment tables, and accuracy metrics

### Demo and Results
- **Video Demo**: [1-minute demonstration](https://www.loom.com/share/8704f63e2d2e4b4db23eab673d7990a2)
- **WandB Run**: [Experiment tracking](https://wandb.ai/goofymath/goofy_math/runs/z92gd2j4)
